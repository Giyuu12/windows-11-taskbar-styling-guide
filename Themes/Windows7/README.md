# Windows7 theme for Windows 11 Taskbar Styler

This theme is mostly a proof of concept, and due to the limitations of the XAML taskbar it is not accurate to Windows 7. If you want an accurate Windows 7 taskbar, check out [Explorer7](https://winclassic.net/thread/2588/explorer7-windows-explorer-10-11) or ep_taskbar.
